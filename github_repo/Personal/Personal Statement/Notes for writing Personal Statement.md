#### Pointers:
- DO NOT USE CHAT GPT, LITERALLY WHY WOULD YOU USE IT IN A 'PERSONAL' STATEMENT YOU MELON.
- They aren't too bothered about what information goes in which box, as long as the information is there and it makes sense.
- Be prepared to answer questions about what you put in your personal statement. DO NOT LIE
- When you talk about your subject, say that you are INTERESTED in it, not passionate about it.


For question 2:
- Don't repeat any of the information on your UCAS application. Make sure everything on there is new
	-This includes things in school. DO NOT JUST LIST THINGS IN THE COURSE YOU'RE DOING
Instead, you can talk about how what you've learnt in lesson lead to further research. 

For question 3:
- Talk about work experience, Cambridge quite like it apparently
- Talk about super curricular activities predominantly(on top of studies), instead of extra curricular, like sports(you can talk about them, but only recommended to be brief).

### My Cambridge Application:
- Completed a week after the UCAS deadline
- Only seen by the university of Cambridge, so you have the chance to be specific about the university here.
- Required, application for Cambridge can't be completed unless it is done
- Contains optional second personal statement, can be filled out as much as required to give the university more information about yourself. 
- Recommended to look at Cambridge course, and talk about things that line up with their specific course.
