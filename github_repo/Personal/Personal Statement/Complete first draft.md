# Question 1(1245 characters) - Why do you want to study this course or subject?

For me perspective has always been the most important part of mathematics, and seeing  the different challenges I face continue to evolve my perspective has always been what drives me to keep questioning and learning about the nature of our world.

A prime example of this was in my participation in the UK Senior maths challenge, where I was able to achieve a silver certificate. The open format of the questions forced me to improvise my own methods to solve them, as opposed to the more consistent structure of the A Level and GCSE papers I had grown accustomed to. In sitting their papers, I was reminded once again just how many different ways we could apply maths, reinforcing my interest and desire to learn more.

I have also loved developing my own style of clear, concise communication, as collaborating with people in my field shows me perspectives that I would never be able to find as an individual. In order to best communicate my ideas in today's online based world I decided to learn the LaTeX typesetting language, as it then allowed me to digitally share my approaches or ideas around anything mathematical, in turn meaning that I was able to share my thoughts much more efficiently, and to a larger number of my peers at once.
# Question 2(1897 characters) - How have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this subject?

Geometry is a topic that I have grown to love through the progression of my studies. My investment in geometry began with Computational Geometry, where my main interest was in how small inefficiencies in algorithms like physics engines could exponentially increase their required processing time. Seeing these different engines then inspired me to create my own bacterial growth simulation using Object Oriented Python.

It was in formally learning about 3 Dimensional vectors and planes that my interest in the maths behind geometry was ignited. Whilst learning the vector and scalar product allowed me to improve my bacterial growth simulation, I found myself more drawn to the nature of points, lines and planes. 

Edward Abbott's Flatland was both the foundation for my learning around geometry, and an incredibly entertaining social satire of his time. I found the most impactful part of Flatland to be the characters' scepticism towards any dimensions higher than theirs. And after having empathised with their perspective I saw how wonderfully unsettling it is to even think that we can, at any moment, be watched from an entirely unreachable direction.

This realisation deepened my appreciation for the complexity of geometry, and made it inevitable that I would start researching how we interpreted a 4th dimension. Attempting to understand and visualise a 4th dimension was the first time I felt truly lost in maths, with the new concepts of stacking cubes and world tubes forcing me the furthest out of my comfort zone I had ever gone, requiring both a flexible perspective and a high resilience to make progress in my understanding. 

The journey of learning how objects move 'Upward, and yet not Northward' through our world has been both incredibly challenging and rewarding,  and through it I have learnt that all mathematics is learnable, as long as I keep the will to make it so.
# Question 3(832 Characters) - What else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?

In my free time, I enjoy following the different YouTube videos that 3Blue1Brown posts, as he covers a perfect blend of mathematical and Computer Science based content. I especially loved his work on lying with visual proofs as they showed me the importance of being clear and explicit in my communication, whilst also showing the maths breaking consequences that even a single piece of implied information can have on the result. I have also regularly attended a selection of different online workshops with my friends, where different Universities would give taster lessons on topics like the Pigeon Hole Principle and its applications. Whilst I did find the content  in these sessions thought provoking, I primarily enjoyed being able to work alongside other people who were just as invested in the field of mathematics as I was.
