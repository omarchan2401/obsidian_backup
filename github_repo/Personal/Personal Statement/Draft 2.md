### Question 1(1198 characters) - Why do you want to study this course or subject? 

For me perspective has always been the most important part of mathematics; seeing as my life’s challenges continue to mould and remake my perspective drives me to keep questioning and learning about the nature of our world. 

The UK Senior maths challenge, in which I achieved a silver certificate, let me develop an interest and appreciation for problems with a less clear focus. The intentionally limited information in these questions encouraged a mixture of deductive reasoning and logical thinking to reach conclusions, making me apply the concepts I had learned in my classes to new environments.   

I have also loved developing my own style of clear, concise communication, as collaborating with people in my field shows me new approaches that I would never be able to find as an individual. To best communicate my ideas in today's online world I decided to learn the LaTeX typesetting language, allowing me to digitally share my ideas and approaches to a range of different problems. I found this especially useful when working with my peers on longer issues containing vectors or matrices,  as the techniques used to solve them were more difficult to convincingly reason with normal text.

### Question 2(2002 characters) - How have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this subject? 

Geometry is a topic that I have grown to love through the progression of my studies. My investment in geometry began with Computational Geometry, where my main interest was in how small inefficiencies in algorithms like physics engines could exponentially increase their required processing time. Seeing these different engines then inspired me to create my own bacterial growth simulation using Object Oriented Python.

It was in formally learning about 3D vectors and planes that my interest in the maths behind geometry was ignited. Through my classes, I saw how the scalar product could make my simulation more realistic by introducing partially elastic collisions. Despite this, I found myself more drawn to the nature of points, lines and planes.

Edward Abbott's Flatland was both the foundation for my further learning around geometry, and an incredibly entertaining social satire of his time. I found the most impactful part of Flatland to be the characters' scepticism towards any dimensions higher than theirs. After having empathised with their perspective I saw how wonderfully unsettling it is to even think that we can, at any moment, be watched from an entirely unreachable direction.

This realisation deepened my appreciation for the complexity of geometry, and made me start researching how we interpreted a 4th dimension. In my research I focused on how a 4th dimension is applied in linear algebra, imagining a 4th dimension(w) as another direction used to describe location, as opposed to time. By thinking of the direction w conceptually, I was able to draw a parallel in how a 4D shape would be projected into ours. With the projected image of a 4D shape being transformed by its w value, similar to how the shadow of a solid changes as its light source moves.

The journey of learning how an object would move 'Upward, and yet not Northward' through our world has been both incredibly challenging and rewarding, and has only deepened my thirst for more knowledge in this topic.


### Question 3(855 Characters) - What else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful? 

In my free time, I enjoy following the different YouTube videos that 3Blue1Brown posts, as he covers a perfect blend of mathematical and Computer Science based content. I especially loved his work on lying with visual proofs as they showed me the importance of being clear and explicit in my communication, whilst also showing the illogical consequences that even a single piece of implied information can have on the result. I have also regularly attended a selection of different online workshops, where different Universities would give taster lessons on topics like the Pigeon Hole Principle, and how it can be used to find guaranteed repetitions in groups. Whilst I did find the content in these sessions thought provoking, I primarily enjoyed being able to work alongside other people who were just as invested in the field of mathematics as I was.
