### Second question it. 1
 When preparing for my GCSEs I found myself interested in the lines and curves used to model relationships between 2 variables. Being able to fully describe the links between two separate pieces of data in the form of just a graph fascinated me at the time, and inspired me to find opportunities that would let me identify links between variables, and then describe them in the form of a pure graph.

Recently, I was able to find a problem that let me explore this, as well as develop my programming skills. Previously, in my Computer Science NEA I had created three key variables that I would later use to calculate the reproductive rate for a culture of bacteria, with the variables being: the temperature bounds the strain could live at, the temperature of the environment, and the nutrient richness of the surroundings. My immediate thoughts were to use a normal distribution function to represent my rate. However this proved to be a non viable option

I also enjoyed its illustrations on how shapes of a higher dimension would appear from the perspective of lower  ones, as they gave me a new perspective, where instead of imagining a 3 dimensional shape as a solid, I could instead imagine it as an infinite number of layered 2 dimensional shapes.

The UK Senior maths challenge, in which I achieved a silver certificate, let me develop an interest and appreciation for problems with a less clear focus. The intentionally limited information in these questions encouraged a mixture of deductive reasoning and logical thinking to reach conclusions, making me apply the concepts I had learned in my classes to new environments.
