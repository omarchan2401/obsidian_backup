### Question 1 - Why do you want to study this course or subject?

For me, perspective has always been the most important part of mathematics. Watching as each hour of my practice and learning changed how I thought not just about the problems I faced in class, but also the problems outside of them, has been one of the most formative experiences of my life. 




### Question 2 - How have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this subject?


### Question 3 - What else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?
