#### Pointers:
- DO NOT USE CHAT GPT, LITERALLY WHY WOULD YOU USE IT IN A 'PERSONAL' STATEMENT YOU MELON.
- They aren't too bothered about what information goes in which box, as long as the information is there and it makes sense.
- Be prepared to answer questions about what you put in your personal statement. DO NOT LIE

For question 2:
- Don't replicate any of the information on your UCAS application. Make sure everything on there is new
	-This includes things in school. DO NOT JUST LIST THINGS IN THE COURSE
Instead, you can talk about how what you've learnt in lesson lead to further research.

For question 3:
- Talk about work experience, Cambridge quite like it apparently
- Talk about super curricular activities predominantly(on top of studies), instead of extra curricular, like sports(you can talk about them, but only recommended to be brief).

### My Cambridge Application:
- Completed a week after the UCAS deadline
- Only seen by the university of Cambridge, so you have the chance to be specific about the university here.
- Required, application for Cambridge can't be completed unless it is done
- Contains optional second personal statement, can be filled out as much as required to give the university more information about yourself. 
- Recommended to look at Cambridge course, and talk about things that line up with their specific course.
