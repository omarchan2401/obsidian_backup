It looks like a conservation of momentum question, and also looks like a collision even though there's a string in there???<br><br>For question 4 part c, I don't understand why my equations lead me to have the reversed answers for $V_a$ and $V_b$<br><br>Key takeaways:<br>• Average power and velocity seem to come up relatively often, be careful about what you put into your equations when you use them<br>• Be mindful about what Dimensional Analysis actually does (setting up 3 simultaneous equations you can solve), and how it limits us to 3 unknowns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

I didn't fully understand how the $\Sigma{W} = \Delta{E_k} + \Delta{E_p}$ worked for this question. The energy lost from the kinetic store went into work done against resistance forces, and the objects $E_p$. We had to use this principle as well as knowing that our object started with only kinetic energy to find out that Initial $E_k$ = Work done against resistive force * Final $E_p$<br><br>• 6C. I honestly didn't know where to start, why is $\gamma=\>1\>or\>0$.<br><br>• Question 8. I had another problem with not recognising how $\Sigma{W} = \Delta{E_k} + \Delta{E_p}$ works, but in this case I needed to realise that $\Sigma{W} = W(applied) - W(resistive)$  (as my work done in my direction of travel and my work done against resistance work in different directions).<br><br>This meant that my actual work energy principle was $W(applied) - W(resistive) = \Delta{E_k} + \Delta{E_p}$ <br>Therefore in order to find the work done of my pump I needed to account for the resistive work done as well.<br><br>Therefore meaning that I calculated my power wrong. |

It helped me realise that I was wrong about some of my work on energy.<br><br>I realised that my work energy principle was wrong, and that it actually is $E_P(initial) + E_K(initial) +\Sigma{W} = E_P(final) + E_K(final)$<br><br>Where $\Sigma{W}$ only consists of EXTERNAL forces, not including weight or Normal Contact Forces.<br><br>Every other application of Work and energy is a simpler version of this equation.<br><br>Dimensional analysis on this paper was nice as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
