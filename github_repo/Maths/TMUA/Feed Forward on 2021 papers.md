|       10        |    Yes     |     No     | Yes. Only issue with this question was remembering the trapezium rule:<br><br>$\large \int_a^b{f(x) dx} \approx \frac{h}{2}[f(a) + f(b) +2(f(a+1) + f(a+2) + ... + f(b-1))]$                                                                                                                                        |
|       11        |  Yes<br>   |     No     | Yes. I struggled to factorise the weird form polynomial, and would have struggled to quickly find a way to identify the range for which f(x) was decreasing.<br><br>Although I learnt a pretty cool grid method for linear factors that can show me as long as i know the bounds i'm working around.                |
|       12        |  Yes<br>   |     No     | Yes. I wasn't farmilliar with completing the square with a quartic. I saw the general idea of what to do, but didn't check that what i was doing was mathematically right by expanding out again :(.                                                                                                                |
|       14        |  Yes<br>   |     No     | Yes. This question was just raw graphing. In the paper I remember the part that caught me out was the part about x being in radians.                                                                                                                                                                                |

|       18        |  Yes<br>   |     No     | Yes. A handy trick for that question was to switch the variables x and y in order to get a more familiar form to manipulate. After finishing manipulation I could have swapped the x and y again in order to put it in original form (swapping x & y in an equation has the effect of reflecting in the line y = x) |

|        6        | Yes<br>    | No         | Yes. This was a really good question to help me understand how to go about deciding sufficiency & necessity. Using 'if A then B' for A suff. B, and 'if B then A' for A necess. B , and then trying to find situations that broke the if __ then __ statem                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Needed to see that both equations needed to hold, and then see that the question wanted me to find t                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                What was right:<br>Yes. After drawing out the situation, we can see that in order for our circle to tangent the Y axis, the point (0, $\large\frac{b}{2}$) would need to lie on our circle, and our radius would need to be $\large\sqrt{\frac{a^2}{4} + \frac{b^2}{4} -c}$.<br><br>Substituting our value of intersection into our equation, we're left with $y^2 + by + c = 0$ as an equation that represents this intersection. By taking the discriminant, and forcing it to be =0, we can then see that the condition that is both necessary and sufficient for our circle to be tangent to the Y axis is $b^2 = 4c$, AKA option B.<br><br>What was wrong:<br>However, the condition of our radius being this is, whilst necessary, not sufficient by itself, as all it describes when isolated is the size of the circle, meaning that it actually describes an infinite number of circles with the same radius. However all of these circles are limited to having -a/2 be their radius. $\therefore$ meaning that they can only be on 1 side of the axis, meaning that we're only counting for half of the possible cases.<br><br>Therefore it must be A or B.<br><br>The key takeaway for this question was to consider the validity of our answers for a bit, before diving into our question, as this would have eliminated a lot of the choices for me quickly. fore$  s. $$  s. $$  s. $$  s. %%  dius.   of . |
