# Things to work on:
- Inequalities - these kinds of questions are hard for me to start. Partly because I don't see the things that we can do with them i.e adding or subtracting inequalities from each other.
- Necessity, sufficiency & negation could use some practice 
- Turning statements into their 'if A then B' forms could also use some practice.



$\huge \lvert{x + b}\rvert < a$



$$
\Huge{
\begin{aligned} 

\lvert{}x + b\rvert{} &< a \\
\implies-a<x+b&<a \\
\implies-(a-b)<x&<a-b\\
\implies b-a<x&< a-b

\end{aligned}
}
