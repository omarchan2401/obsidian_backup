|         20          |      C       |       F        |
Score: 13/20 (1 was a lucky guess mark from Q 18)

## Improvements to make:
- I need to take a look at ratios 
- I definitely need to be sketching more when dealing with anything remotely algebraic
- I need to have a system that lets me skip questions I don't like the look of in favour of easier ones, as I didn't even get to try Questions 18-20 inclusive.

Overall, this test went ok. Nothing in this test was impossible. I lost ~2 marks to errors where my own wrong workings out messed up my perfect method.

Score: 5/20.

## Improvements to make:

- OH MY GOD THIS WAS THE WORST PAPER EVER  
- This paper contained a lot of extended reasoning and the logical argument sections had a lot of pitfalls.
- That being said, there were also a few questions where I just ended up throwing away some marks due to sloppy thinking or working.
- A big issue here was just not knowing when to give up, I stayed wayyyy too long on some questions that I was not realistically going to get.
- Just an overall bad performance, but it happens, so is ok.



## Takeaways:

1) You need to be more comfortable in skipping questions you are obviously struggling with.
2) You need to practice a lot more on logical reasoning.
