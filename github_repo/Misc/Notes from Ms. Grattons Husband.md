#### STEP PREP:
- Typical offers need A\*A\*A including a STEP grade, with the A*'s being in Maths and Further Maths.
- STEP exams are done at the same time as your A Levels. You will also have your offer be decided before you take the set of papers.
- IMPORTANT- START PREPPING NOW.
- There is no secret 'technique' to passing, it's just raw practice :(
- STEP PREP will automatically raise your skill level in maths, so it does translate over
	- $\frac{1}{4}$ of students can achieve an A\* in FM.
	- Only $\frac{1}{2}$ of the people who take the STEP and meet the grade requirements for an offer actually achieve their required grades (1 or S)
	- $\frac{1}{3}$ of students who don't meet their STEP grade (high 2 instead of a 1) still get offers.
- Cambridge prefers for its STEP takers to complete fewer questions with a higher quality response in comparison to answering a lot of questions with overall worse responses.
	- A FEW QUESTIONS DONE WELL IS BETTER THAN A LOT DONE PARTIALLY
- There is also a pooling system for if the specific college you applied to rejects you. In this pool colleges get to pick students that they can give offers to.


### CLASS CULTURE:
- 1st year - teaching is delivered in 2 forms: lectures and group work (supervisions)
	- Lectures - Taught
	- Group work - work with 1 or 2 other students to go through learnt content
- 24 lecture courses
- Your college organises the smaller group sessions of your teaching
- Problem sheets - Cambridge will give these for you to solve with another student
	- Expected to take a week per sheet
	- Each sheet has \~13 questions
	- At the end of the week you will have a supervision that will let you and your partner present your ideas to someone who can help give feedback. This is usually a professor or fellow.
- You are expected to both work approx. 8 hours a day, use other students, and take 2 days to a week to complete each sheet.
- Expected to consolidate and work through holidays?
- Terms in Cambridge are more compressed and intense in comparison to other Universities. This will also mean that you have longer breaks to both relax and consolidate what you've been taught.
- GENDER SPLIT - not good :(
- 

### COLLEGE SPECIFIC:
- Extra interviews are college specific.
	-Kings college tries to give individual interviews to the candidates they think are viable
	-2 weeks before interview they are given a test that the college uses to see the ability of the student(Kings college specific).
	-They can then use the responses to this test to see the thought process of the student being interviewed.
- 

### INTERVIEWS:
- Come after you've submitted your early app. and MCA
	- 2nd Personal statement on the MCA - Use the space to talk about things that relate more specifically to Cambridge (course modules you're interested in, extra reading or super curriculars that relate to them)
	- 
- Colleges that use interviews value the personal statement less, as they can get a better judge of you then(the inverse is true in other unis that don't do this).
