### Q: Give 2 similarities and 2 differences between a Tree and a Graph.

#### Similarities:

- Both contain nodes with pointers that are used to traverse the structure
- Both have a similar deletion process

#### Differences:
- Binary trees have multiple branches
- *Graphs can have an unlimited number of links to a node, Binary trees can only have 0,1,2.

Other Answers:
- Both consist of nodes
- Both are connected by edges/links
- Both are non-linear data structures
- Both are dynamic data structures

- Tree is 1-directional, graph is 2
- Tree has a root node, graph does not
- Trees will not have circles, graphs will
- Trees will not have weighted links, unlike graphs which can.
