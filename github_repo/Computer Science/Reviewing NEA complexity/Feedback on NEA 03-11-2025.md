## General Notes:
- 1-2-1's at some point
- They have only skimmed out NEA's currently
- Priya and Bowen will be giving their marked NEA's to each other to cross check
- There haven't been any glaring emissions YET.
- AI checker - Individual reports have been generated for each student. HOWEVER these will not be given to students, as they may be used against Bowen.
- Justification found to be slightly lacking in a few places - especially with Evaluation.
