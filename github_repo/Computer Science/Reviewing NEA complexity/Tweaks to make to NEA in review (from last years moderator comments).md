### Design
- Make sure to have the right amount of detail for your algorithms


#### Development
- Check to see if, for JSON, you've described how specifically IN YOUR NEA you are retrieving and changing values.
- When problems have been fixed, make sure that you also include how you could solve the problem in the future with what you know now.
- When you have made mini changes to design, include a mini evaluation of the changes made, and justify why you've made the change in the first place.
- In iteration 3, just before you actually start using the PyQt Graph library, write a mini introduction to describe the library, in the same way that you did before for matplotlib.
- Make sure that your in-development test tables line up.
